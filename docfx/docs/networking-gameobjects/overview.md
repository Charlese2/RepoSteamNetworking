Networking GameObjects is a bit more involved than more official solutions like Photon or Unity Netcode, but it's *usable*.

Source Generators offload most if not all the boilerplate. As such, I will not write documentation for implementing the boilerplate by hand. So make sure you followed [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) to ensure you have the Source Generators installed.
